# Linear Classifier vs Neural Network

Based on the CS231n Class of Stanford University, we first create a 2D Spiral Toy Dataset and classify the dataset using a Linear Classifier.
Then a Neural Network with backpropagation is made with loss function and weights and biases. 
It is then used to classify the toy dataset again and proves to be much better than the linear classifier.
